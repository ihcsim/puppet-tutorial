This is a sample [Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet) manifests project based on the [Learning Puppet](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/) tutorial site. It contains some basic manifests created to aid my personal learning.

To run each manifest, execute this command from the terminal:

```puppet apply $script.pp```
